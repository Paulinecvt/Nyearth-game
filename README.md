Nyearth
### H3
by Pauline Cvt

** The brief **
As a student of Iron Hack learning Web Development, my first project is a browser game where obstacles are displayed and a collision with the player triggers a Game Over.

** My idea **
Colors, galaxy and ecology are the main center of Nyearth, a game where you need to help a little rainbow planet to survive another overshoot day, avoiding trashes before the end of the day.

** Basics **
- Use arrow keys to move Nyearth in the galaxy and avoid obstacles !
- Be careful, the obstacles are faster and faster when the end of the day is close !
- A short challenging game full of colors !

** Features ** 
- Challenge yourself into the Ego Mode where trashes are way more present !
- Have fun with some background music to remember the NyanCat's inspo !
- Sensibilize yourself about overshoot day and the dangers our planet is facing !
- Be amazed by the kawaii-ness of Nyearth... when it doesn't crash into a plastic bottle !
